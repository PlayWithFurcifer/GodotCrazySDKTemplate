# Godot 3 CrazySDK Integration - Template Project

[CrazyGames](https://www.crazygames.com/) is a webgame platform that offers a revenue share on ads. It's really easy to get started. This Godot project wraps CrazySDK v2 and can be used as a template for integrating the SDK into your games.

The SDK is loaded via HTML5 (see Export preset) and accessed in CrazySDK.gd. You can simply add this file to your own project and add it as an Autoload singleton. Then, you can request ads from anywhere in your code, and more. 

Make an account and submit your game [here](https://developer.crazygames.com/). 
Find more info in the [SDK documentation](https://docs.crazygames.com/).
